### What is TensorFlow . ?
Tensorflow is an open-source libraries for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning that ease Google Brain TensorFlow, the process of acquiring data, training models, serving predictions, and refining future results.


##Object clasification Using Tensorflow and COCO dataset

Tensorflow bundles together Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and algorithms. It uses Python as a convenient front-end and runs it efficiently in optimized C++.
we are going to use tensorflow framework and coco data set for trainig and detcting objects with live web cam .
